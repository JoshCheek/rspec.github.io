  <p>RSpec 3.1 has just been released! Given our commitment to
<a href="http://semver.org/">semantic versioning</a>, this should be a trivial
upgrade for anyone already using RSpec 3.0, but if we did introduce
any regressions, please let us know, and we'll get a patch release
out with a fix ASAP.</p>

<p>RSpec continues to be a community-driven project with contributors
from all over the world. This release includes 647 commits from 190
pull requests from 47 different contributors.</p>

<p>Thank you to everyone who helped make this release happen...</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.andylindeman.com/">Andy Lindeman</a>, who has been working on RSpec
with me for a couple years, has decided to retire from the RSpec core team.
In his current job at GitHub, he's using Ruby and Rails much less than
he used to. It has been really great to have the chance to work with Andy
over the last few years. I can't thank him enough. His work on
rspec-rails in particular (since he's been lead maintainer) has been
awesome. We wish him well in his future endeavors.</p>

<p>RSpec 3 is the work of many, many people, and it never would have happened without
the community contributing to it. Special thanks to:</p>

  <p>One of RSpec 3's big new features is shipping 3.0.0.beta2: composable
matchers. This feature supports more powerful, less brittle
expectations, and opens up new possibilities.</p>

<h2 id="an-example">An Example</h2>

<p>In RSpec 2.x, I've written code like this on many occassions:</p>

this</a> available
now.</p>

<p>RSpec 2.0 was released in October 2010. In the nearly three years since
then, we've been able to continually improve RSpec without needing to
make breaking changes, but we've reached a point where RSpec has a fair
bit of cruft stemming from the need to retain backwards
compatibility with older 2.x releases.</p>

<p><a href="/blog/2013/07/rspec-2-14-is-released">RSpec 2.14</a>
will be the last RSpec 2 feature release. (We may do some
bug-fix patch releases, though). We're getting started on...</p>
